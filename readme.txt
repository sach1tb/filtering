Filtering scripts for kalman, extended kalman, and particle filter
To try these, run test_filter.m which generates a sample 3D data from lorenz attractor and tries to filter (track) it using different filters. Comment/uncomment different functions to try out the filters. 
NOTE
% >> in the script means a big change is needed for you to adapt it to your
% setup. e.g. a new likelihood function or measurement model
% ^^ means there are parameters that can be tuned to see if it changes the
% performance
